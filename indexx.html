          <h2>About Water Conservation</h2>
          <p>
            Water is a precious resource that is becoming scarcer each day. In
            many parts of the world, including Kenya, people face water shortages
            and have to find ways to conserve water in order to ensure that there
            is enough for everyone. Water conservation involves using water
            wisely and avoiding waste. There are many ways to conserve water,
            including fixing leaks, using water-efficient appliances, and
            adopting water-saving habits.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our website provides information on water conservation and the steps
            you can take to save water. We also have infographics that show how
            water is used in Kenya and the effects of water shortage on the
            environment and people's lives. Additionally, we have a carousel
            that displays images of places that are experiencing water shortage,
            as well as a contact form that you can use to reach out to us if you
            have any questions or feedback.
